# NameSorter
this is a C# application that takes a list of names in a text time as a command line argument and sorts them before printing the sorted list to screen and to a file called "sorted-names-list.txt".
# Alogrithm
the sorting algorithm iterates through characters in the last names first and if no conclusion is drawn, sorts by the first name and middle name together.
# project structure
The project is seperated into the main ConsoleApp2 solution and a TestProject1 solution. I'm not inimitably familiar with visual studio but I think it is as easy as opening these solutions seperatly and running.
